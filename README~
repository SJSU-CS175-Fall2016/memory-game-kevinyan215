3. N/A
4. Approximately 20 hours 
5. Android version 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich). 5.2" screen size
6. I've created a reset button for the extra credit points, however, the implementation does not work, meaning the states does not reset when the button is pressed. All the other requirements of the homework was completed.
